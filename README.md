Eyes

This is an exercise developed during MIT xPro Professional Certificate in Coding: Women's Cohort September 2022. 

The goal of this exercise is to follow moving objects on the screen with the cursor. It detects cursor position upon entering the screen, stores the coordinates, and updates the center of the eye position accordingly to dynamically follow the movement of the cursor. 

How to Run 
1. Place cursor on the screen and move to see eyes follow it.

To install this project, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the project
2. Add it to your code editor tool
3. Open index.html

Roadmap
